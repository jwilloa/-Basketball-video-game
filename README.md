# Basketball-video-game

## Objectives
Develop initial knowledge used in first assignment and improve the knowledge of the VHDL language.

The task for this assignment is to implement a simplified “Basketball” video game.
The basic layout should include a basket, a ball, and a player. The ball flies, following a
parabolic trajectory, towards the basket. If the ball enters the basket a point is awarded.
By using the controls available on the Basys3 board, the user determines the direction and
intensity of the throw. In “debug mode”, the 4 leftmost switches encode the initial horizontal speed of the ball, 
the next 4 switches encode its vertical speed, and the central button is used to throw
the ball. In “play mode”, it is left to the student to decide the details of the user interface and how
to make the game more challenging.
